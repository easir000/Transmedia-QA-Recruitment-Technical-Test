Step 1: Set Up Postman
Open Postman.
Create a new collection named Easir2 API Automation.
Step 2: Add New Lists
Create a new request in the Easir2 API Automation collection:

Name: Add List 1
Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:3000/api/lists


{
  "name": "List 1",
  "boardId": 16
}
Save the request.


Add List 2 body:

{
  "name": "List 2",
  "boardId": 16
}
Add List 3 body:

{
  "name": "List 3",
  "boardId": 16
}
Step 3: Capture List IDs for Deletion
After sending the POST requests to create the lists, capture the id of each newly created list from the response.

Save the response of each request to a variable:

Add List 1 response: listId1
Add List 2 response: listId2
Add List 3 response: listId3


This can be done by using Postman’s Tests tab with the following script:

const response = pm.response.json();
pm.collectionVariables.set("listId1", response.id);

Step 4: Delete Newly Created Lists
Create a new request in the Easir2 API Automation collection:

Name: Delete List 1
Method: DELETE
URL: http://localhost:3000/api/lists
Save the request.
Duplicate the Delete List 1 request to create Delete List 2 and Delete List 3, updating the URL to use listId2 and listId3 respectively:

Delete List 2 URL:

http://localhost:3000/api/lists
Delete List 3 URL:

http://localhost:3000/api/lists
Step 5: Run the Collection

Open the Easir2 API Automation collection in Postman.
Click on the collection’s name and then Run.
Select all the requests (Add List 1, Add List 2, Add List 3, Delete List 1, Delete List 2, Delete List 3).

Click on Run Easir2 API Automation.
Postman will execute the requests in sequence, adding three new lists and then deleting them.
